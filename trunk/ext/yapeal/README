Welcome to Yapeal (Yet Another PHP Eve Api Library)

If you're reading this on your server then you seem to have got Yapeal installed.
In the future I hope to have sections on installing, configuring, setup, and
troubleshooting but for now best I can do is refer you to the project Wiki at
http://code.google.com/p/yapeal/
There you should find information to help you out. Another resource is the forum
thread for Yapeal at Eve Online which you'll find at
http://myeve.eve-online.com/ingameboard.asp?a=topic&threadID=904182

Thanks for using Yapeal, Dragonaire
